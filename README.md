# The open‑source continuation of 8th Wall WebAR

A community‑run hub that tracks 8th Wall’s distributed engine and open‑source tools, with clear documentation, examples, and a GitHub code repository.

---

## Our mission

8thwall.io exists to help developers keep building with 8th Wall technology after the original platform winds down. As 8th Wall distributes its engine as a free binary and open‑sources surrounding components, we collect these official releases, organize them, and make them easier to understand and use.

---

## What we will do

### Track and organize 8th Wall’s open‑source stack

We follow 8th Wall’s official transition plans and releases. As the engine binary, runtime, developer tools, documentation, and sample projects become available, we will mirror and index them, with clear structure and version notes.

### Create practical technical documentation

We write and maintain developer‑focused docs in English、Chinese and Japanese, including:

- Quickstart guides to get your first 8th Wall‑based WebAR experience running
- Core concept explanations and best practices
- Detailed, per‑component guides for every open‑sourced or distributed 8th Wall technology
- Walkthroughs for self‑hosting and offline workflows wherever the license allows

---

## GitHub repository

All community‑maintained examples, starter templates, and helper tools will be published and updated in our GitHub organization at:

GitHub: [https://github.com/gotoar/8thwall](https://github.com/gotoar/8thwall)

Over time, this repository will collect:

- Example projects and small demos built on top of the 8th Wall engine and tools
- Reorganized sample code inspired by the original 8th Wall examples
- Community contributions that make it easier to learn and adopt the tech

## Official 8th Wall transition information

For the authoritative details about 8th Wall’s engine distribution and open‑source plans, please refer to the official announcement on 8thwall.com:


8th Wall Transition Update: [Engine Distribution and Open Source Plans](https://www.8thwall.com/blog/post/202888018234/8th-wall-update-engine-distribution-and-open-source-plans)

We strongly recommend reading this post to understand:

- Which capabilities are included in the distributed engine binary
- Which components are planned to be open‑sourced
- Which Niantic Spatial features will not be available in offline or self‑hosted setups

## Status: before full open‑source release

At this early stage, not all components have been released yet. Some parts of the stack are still under preparation at 8th Wall and will be published over time. 8thwall.io will update as soon as new binaries, tools or repositories become available, so you can treat this site as a living hub that grows with the official transition.

## Disclaimer

8thwall.io is an unofficial, community‑run project.  
We are not 8th Wall or Niantic.  
We do not distribute any proprietary source code.  
We only reference, document, and build on top of what 8th Wall officially releases under their own licenses.

Developers should always review the original licenses and terms from 8th Wall before using the engine binary or open‑source components in production.
